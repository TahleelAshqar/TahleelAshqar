Chess Threat Analyzer — Polymorphic chess engine for move validation and threat detection.
Print Server with Priority Queue — Custom queue implementation with ordered insertion and interface-based design.
Morse Code Decoder Using a Binary Tree — Generic tree structure with recursive traversal for decoding logic.
Social Network Graph with BFS — Graph-based model supporting user connections, lookups, and exception-safe operations.
PIC16 Math Routines (Assembly) — Low-level arithmetic routines written for the PIC microcontroller.
Break-Time Selector App — DOM-driven JavaScript interface for dynamic content selection using jQuery.
Car Management System — JavaScript OOP project for storing, navigating, and displaying user-generated car entries.

**About Me**
I am committed to strengthening my technical foundation through consistent practice, structured projects, and independent learning.
My goal is to grow into a professional software developer by writing clear code, understanding system behavior, and applying engineering best practices.
